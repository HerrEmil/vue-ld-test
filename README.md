# vue-ld-test

Example repo containing Vue.js, Vuex and LaunchDarkly to reproduce issue running lighthouse scans. Run `yarn && yarn serve` to start. Running a lighthouse scan from Chrome DevTools works as normal. Add a LaunchDarkly key in the `.env` file and re-run the app and lighthouse to reproduce scans timing out.
